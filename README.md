Global Game Jam 2020 - "Repair"
</p>
<p align="center"><b>
Josh H (Programming and 'art'), Kieran W (UI) and Dec T (Programming).

Made in 100% Processing 3 (Java).
We set out to make a basic platformer that you would need to "repair" your controls by collecting the appropriate power up and I think that we succeeded.

We aren't artists, but we certainly made art.
